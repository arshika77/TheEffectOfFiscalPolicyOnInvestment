# TheEffectOfFiscalPolicyOnInvestment
This project evaluates the impact of fiscal policy components on private and public investment using data for a panel of fifteen emerging economies over the period 2009-2017. The within estimator and the two step SYS-GMM estimators have been employed for this data analysis in order to make useful inferences.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are:


- To analyze the budgetary components affecting public and private investments in emerging economies.
-	To analyze the impact of functional dependencies on private investment
-	To determine the long run determinants of investment in emerging economies.
-	To determine the robustness of the results to different econometric specifications. 

Panel Regression of 15 emerging economies has been done for this project. Approximately 60 different regressions were carried out using STATA.
